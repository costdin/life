Simple evolution simulator

Some creatures are put in an area, where they perform some actions. At the end
of each generations some creatures are selected for survival (in the current
implementation this is determined by their position) and their genes are used
to create the next generation.

The creatures have very simple brains with sensory neurons (that give some
information on the environment), action neurons (that when activated perform
some action) and intermediate neurons (that connect other neurons).

In the current implementation the creatures can only move or kill each other.
The sensory neurons are activated based on the distance from the border of the
area or density of creatures near the individual.

The code is not optimised at all and the project is not finished, there is even
some commented out code. Possibly the entire approach is not correct, but we
are doing this for fun. 

Strongly inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk (the original
objective was to reimplement the solution describe in the video in Rust).

This project uses SDL to display the creatures doing their things:
Download SDL2-devel-2.*-VC.zip from http://www.libsdl.org/ (http???)
Copy all *.lib file to {User Home}\.rustup\toolchains\stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\lib\rustlib\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\lib
Copy SDL2.dll to the root of the project
